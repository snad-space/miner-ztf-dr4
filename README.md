# ZTF DR4 analysis

Here we do the analysis of ZTF DR4 datasets. A few points:
* The data itself is not present here due to large size.
* The scripts are located in [zwad repository](https://github.com/snad-space/zwad), so be sure to install it before digging here.
* The repository should be private for now, because... because.

### Data (temporial location)
All surves are extragalctic `|b| > 15Â°`, all light curves are "short" `58194.0 < MJD < 58664.0` and have at least 100 detections (in each passband for g+r)
